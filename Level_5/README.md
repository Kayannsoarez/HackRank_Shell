### Problem_41:
Given a CSV file where each row contains the name of a city and its state separated by a comma, your task is to restructure the file in such a way, that three consecutive rows are folded into one, and separated by tab.

### Problem_42:
In this challenge, we practice using the paste command to merge lines of a given file. You are given a CSV file where each row contains the name of a city and its state separated by a comma. Your task is to replace the newlines in the file with semicolons as demonstrated in the sample.

### Problem_43:
In this challenge, we practice using the paste command to merge lines of a given file. You are given a CSV file where each row contains the name of a city and its state separated by a comma. Your task is to restructure the file so that three consecutive rows are folded into one line and are separated by semicolons.

### Problem_44:
Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array and then display the entire array, with a space between each of the countries' names.

### Problem_45:
Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then slice the array and display only the elements lying between positions 3 and 7, both inclusive. Indexing starts from from 0.

### Problem_46:
You are given a list of countries, each on a new line. Your task is to read them into an array and then filter out (remove) all the names containing the letter 'a' or 'A'.

### Problem_47:
Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then, concatenate the array with itself (twice) - so that you have a total of three repetitions of the original array - and then display the entire concatenated array, with a space between each of the countries' names.

### Problem_48:
Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array and then display the element indexed at 3. Note that indexing starts from 0.

### Problem_49:
Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array and then display the count of elements in that array.

### Problem_50:
You are given a list of countries, each on a new line. Your task is to read them into an array and then transform them in the following way: The first capital letter (if present) in each element of the array should be replaced with a dot ('.'). Then, display the entire array with a space between each country's names.
