### Problem 5:
Given two integers, X and Y, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

### Problem 6:
Given two integers, X and Y, identify whether X < Y or X > Y or X=Y. Exactly one of the following lines: X is less than Y. X is greater than Y. X is equal to Y

### Problem 7:
Read in one character from STDIN. If the character is 'Y' or 'y' display "YES". If the character is 'N' or 'n' display "NO". No other character will be provided as input.
