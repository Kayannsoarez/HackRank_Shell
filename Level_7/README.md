### Problem_61:
Given an input file, in each line, highlight all the occurrences of 'thy' by wrapping them up in brace brackets. The search should be case-insensitive.

### Problem_62:
Given n lines of credit card numbers, mask the first 12 digits of each credit card number with an asterisk (i.e., *) and print the masked card number on a new line. Each credit card number consists of four space-separated groups of four digits. For example, the credit card number 1234 5678 9101 1234 would be masked and printed as **** **** **** 1234.

### Problem_63:
Given an input file, with N credit card numbers, each in a new line, your task is to reverse the ordering of segments in each credit card number. Assume that the credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each. If the original credit card number is 1434 5678 9101 1234, transform it to 1234 9101 5678 1434.

### Problem_64:
You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A - Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively. Your task is to identify those lines that do not contain all three scores for students.

### Problem_65:
You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A - Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively. Your task is to identify whether each of the students has passed or failed. A student is considered to have passed if (s)he has a score 50 or more in each of the three subjects.
